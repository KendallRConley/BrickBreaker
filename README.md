# BrickBreaker
A very simple Brick Breaker game made for personal practice using pygame.

Press 's' to start the game. 

Using the paddle, bounce the ball into all the bricks. Blue bricks are worth 1 point, Green are worth 3, and Yellow 5.

Press 'p' anytime to pause the game. Once paused, you can:

		-Press 's' to continue the game.
		-Press 'x' to exit.
		-Press 'r' to restart game and reset score.

Once all bricks are cleared, the game will pause itself. You can either:

		-Press 'c' to continue, which will keep your score and restart the level
		-Press 'x' to exit.
